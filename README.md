# SOCOM-ESP
proof of concept

# REQUIREMENTS
- PCSX2 v2.0+
- SOCOM U.S. NAVY SEALs Black Edition ([SCUS-97134](http://redump.org/disc/5229/))
- PCSX2 must be in full screen in 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio ( 4:3 looks a bit better ) 

# NOTES
- The ESP is kinda drunken as I have not found the correct FOV value.
